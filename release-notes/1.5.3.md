# Version 1.5.3 Change Log (2012-08-17)

## Release Overview

The focus of this release is to make the heatmap collapsible as well as an overhaul of the escalation mechanism.

## New Features

* [196] - Support collapsing of heatmap swim lanes via UI controls.
* [234] - Clicking on a ring in the overview page will open up a light box containing a cutdown heatmap for the relevant pair.
* [233] - Scan summary information will be persisted.
* [241] - Escalations are now phased rather than running as a batch action on completion of scan.
* [248] - Escalations can trigger an ignore.

* [251] - Escalations for a particular pair can be deleted via the API.

## General Maintenance

* [240] - Never default the username to guest and control default domain from one entry point.
