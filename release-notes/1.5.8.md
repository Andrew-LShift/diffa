# Version 1.5.8 Change Log (2013-03-18)

## Release Overview

This release addresses an issue that was causing Diffa's real-time monitoring via AMQP to incorrectly reject messages.

## General Maintenance

* [284] Fixed bug where the domain wasn't being populated into the endpoints configuration, which in turn caused failed endpoint lookups as the AccentReceiver processed AMQP messages. This issue does not affect later versions of Diffa where domains have been superceeded by spaces.

## Upgrading

Diffa will automatically upgrade itself to this version from release 1.4.4.1.
