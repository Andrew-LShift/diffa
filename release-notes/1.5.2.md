# Version 1.5.2 Change Log (2012-07-23)

## Release Overview

The thrust of this release is to decouple scanning up- and downstream applications so that they can be scanned individually.

## New Features

* [230] - Don't try to scan an endpoint that doesn't support scanning.

## General Maintenance

* [232] - Address a configuration issue whereby one would sometimes be redirected to an incorrect URL on login.
* [231] - Allow different views within an endpoint to contain categories with a common name.

## Upgrading

Diffa will automatically upgrade itself to this version from release 1.4 onwards.
